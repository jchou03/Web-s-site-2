            <p id="0"><strong>Dio is a Junior at High School. Throughout this website you will play 5 different takes of his first week as a Junior.</strong></p>
            <p id="1">Dio woke with a start as his alarm clock blared in his ear. He groggily looked at the time- 7:30 A.M.- time to get up.</p>
            <p id="2">Dio gets ready for school in his purple shirt and yellow suit. Dio gets to school and meets three friends: Emma, Ethan and Alex. Alex was the chill guy who did well in his classes. He never missed a class and was always on top of his work. He wore a white striped polo shirt and khaki pants. Ethan was the typical cool kid who wore baggy black clothes, and always had his hair gelled. He didn’t care about school or grades at all, prefering to make jokes during class, distracting from the lesson, and had to be forced to pass his classes. He was very kind spirited though, always supportive of his friends, but he didn’t hesitate to make fun of them. Emma was the confident one in the group, more popular than the rest of them. Her long yellow hair contrasting with her faded blue T-shirt. She was more of a tomboy, more physically capable than even Alex, who was on the school track team. </p>
            <p id="3">
                They were hanging around in the school courtyard, the voices of the other students screaming becoming a white silence. The four of them in a sea of people which would be overwhelming to anybody not used to it.
                <br>"Today is super crowded huh?" Dio says as he approaches the group. "Usually I can at least see you guys from farther than five feet away."
                <br>"Imagine that." Emma responded with a quirky smile on her face.
                <br>"Good morning Dio. How did you sleep last night?"
                <br>Ethan laughed, "Alex, that’s the first thing you ask people in the morning? ‘How did you sleep last night?’ That’s so weird."
                <br>"I just thought it would be a kind way to greet somebody, and I was trying it out," Alex responded, "anyways, it’s better than you. You haven’t even said anything to Dio."
                <br>"Anyways, I think it is really crowded here, I kind of want to go somewhere else." Dio stated apologetically.
            </p>
            <p id="4">
                <br>“Alright, that makes sense. You wanna come to the library with me? I want to check out some new fiction books, and I think there might be a few that you might like.” Emma cunningly offered.
                <br>“Let’s go to class, I can get help with homework from the teacher,” Alex argued, “and you can actually catch up on yesterday’s work because someone decided to sleep through chemistry class yesterday.”
                <br>“Imagine actually trying to pass your classes.” Ethan just laughed wildly. “Oh! How could I not have realized earlier? You have to choose between the girl and actually passing your classes!”
                <br>“You jerk,” Emma gently punched Ethan on the arm. “I can’t believe you sometimes.”
                <br>“It was such a low hanging fruit though, and I went for it,” Ethan said as he rubbed his arm. “Also, have you ever thought of trying to not break arms when you punch people?”
                <br>“Absolutely, just not with you.” Emma responded sarcastically.
                <br>Alex interrupted before things got too out of hand, “Well you can keep trying to fight Emma, but I really don’t think you have a chance Ethan. Anyways, I should go before the teacher starts screaming at me for not coming early enough, are you coming with Dio?”

            </p>
            <p id="5" class="choice"><button id="normal">Go with Alex</button> <button id="depression">Go Alone</button> <button id="romance">Go with Emma</button> <button id="comedy">Go with Ethan</button> <button id="chaos">Skip School</button></p>
                <p id="normal1">normal</p>

            <p id="normal1">“So, what did I end up missing yesterday?” Dio asked.</p>
            <p id="normal2">
                “Not too much, still mostly introducing the new unit, but there was some classwork that you missed. We can go talk to him and get another copy of the sheet, and you can copy my notes.” Alex replied.
            </p>
            <p id="normal3">“Ah, thanks, that’s a big help, I don’t think Mr. Duncan would be too happy with me if I didn’t have them”</p>
            <p id="normal4">“No worries.” Alex assured as they continued into the class and set their backpacks down on a couple of adjacent seats near the front. </p>
            <p id="normal5">“We’ve got a few minutes before class starts, want to see Mr. Duncan about the homework?”</p>
            <p id="normal6">
                “Sure, and you can grab the classwork page”
                They walked over to Mr. Duncan, and as Alex asked about the homework, Dio tried to look around the class for extra copies of the sheet - before eventually giving up and going over to Mr. Duncan to ask for one. When he got back to the desk, Alex had already started on the days sheet.
            </p>
            <p id="normal7">“Man, already starting with that? There’s still a minute or so before class starts”</p>
            <p id="normal8">“Well it’s mostly pretty easy, I think my middle school chem class covered a lot of this”</p>
            <p id="normal9">And you actually remember that?” Dio challenged. Alex just smiled and got back to work. Dio decided to see if he knew any of the stuff on the page, after a quick skim, though, he found himself completely disheartened. He didn’t recognize any of the terminology or formulas, and he had no idea how to even start the first problem. He decided just to wait for Mr. Duncan to explain in class.</p>
            <p id="normal10">“Alright class,” Mr. Duncan announced, “Let's start out with this.” He started drawing out a problem on the board. Dio was already bored, though, and thought: “maybe I should just sleep through this again... ”</p>
            <p id="normal11" class="choice"><button id="sleep">Go to Sleep</button> <button id="awake">Stay Awake</button></p>
                <p id="sleep1">Dio lays down on the table,shuts his eyes, and tries to drown out all of the classroom noise and get to sleep. After a few pokes from Alex, he finally succeeded, successfully dodging all of the classwork like an absolute gamer yet again. After class, Alex woke him up, and although he looked a little upset and disappointed, he insisted “It’s fine, but at least do the work at home tonight”</p>
                <p id="sleep2">“Sure, it looked pretty easy, so I should be able to finish it in half an hour or so.”</p>
                <p id="sleep3">“Sure, sure,” he paused for a moment, “There’s break now, isn’t there?”</p>
                <p id="sleep4">“Yup, why do you ask?”</p>
                <p id="sleep5">“I was wondering if I had enough time to go to the restroom”</p>
                <p id="sleep6">“Ah, well see you later then?”</p>
                <p id="sleep7">“See ya”</p>
                <p id="sleep8">They split ways after leaving the classroom, and the rest of the day went normally, <strong>good job!</strong></p>
                <p id="awake1">Dio stays up and tries to pay close attention to class and complete his classwork. After half an hour or so, he feels surprisingly fulfilled, having completed both of the classwork sheets, and now just requiring the notes from Alex. “Hey,” he asks, “Could I see your notes from yesterday?”</p>
                <p id="awake2">“Sure, honestly though I’m really surprised you were able to stay up throughout the whole lesson, nice job”</p>
                <p id="awake3">“Thanks”</p>
                <p id="awake4">After getting the notes, there is still about 20 minutes left in class, so he decides to get some more sleep. Alex gets him up at the end of class, and after packing up, and the rest of the day went normally, <strong>good job!</strong></p>


            <p id="depression1">“Actually, I have to go to the bathroom, I’ll see you guys later,” Dio said.</p>
            <p id="depression2">“Alright, see you later,” Emma replied as she turned to leave.</p>
            <p id="depression3">“Damn, I really think you need help, but I’ll see you around,” Alex said reluctantly.</p>
            <p id="depression4">Ethan walked up to Dio, “You failed to pick an option, you are now a loner... Just kidding. See you, dude.”</p>
            <p id="depression5">Dio’s friends walked away and he was left to wander in the sea of people that was his school. Dio didn’t actually have to use the bathroom and had just used it as an excuse to have some alone time.</p>
            <p id="depression6">He walked down the hall looking for a place to sit quietly and just think. As he walked, a familiar face came walking down the hall towards him. It was Ethan, knowing that he had lied to Alex about having to go to the bathroom, he had to find a way to avoid him. Luckily, there was a bathroom on the left.</p>
            <p id="depression7" class="choice"><button id="bathroom">Go to the Bathroom</button> <button id="walking">Keep Walking</button></p>
                <p id="bathroom1">Dio made a swift turn into the bathroom and the door shut behind him. He decided to wait for Ethan to pass without it seeming too suspicious, so he waited for a little bit. Suddenly he heard footsteps approach the door and he didn’t want to look weird just standing in the bathroom.</p>
                <p id="bathroom2" class="choice"><button class="option1">Jump into a Stall</button> <button class="option2">Start Washing Your Hands</button></p>

            <p id="romance1">“I think I’ll go with Emma. Thanks for the offer though Alex.” Dio stated. Ethan started to eye Dio up with a smirk, but remained silent. Dio shot back a sharp glare but Ethan kept that look on his face.</p>
            <p id="romance2">“Alright, just don’t come crying to me when you don’t have your chem notes.” Alex warned.</p>
            <p id="romance3">“Wait we had notes? Dude, Mr. Duncan grades so harshly on notes, I better get them done.”</p>
            <p id="romance4">“Yes oh my god, you are just such egg sometimes. Does that mean you are coming?”</p>
            <p id="romance5">“Lol, you thought. See you guys during break.” Dio dismissed Alex and Ethan and turned to walk towards the library with Emma. She smiled at him, then turning forward to push through the crowd. Her golden hair seemed to gently brush against his arm as he tried to stick close to her as they navigated the thick crowd. His body moved side to side as he bumped into backpack then arm, over and over, as he pushed through, following his focus on Emma who was way ahead of him at that point.</p>
            <p id="romance6">Have I always focused on Emma so much before? Dio thought. Eh, I’m trying to focus on not losing her in this crowd as we go the the library, it just makes sense. He dismissed the thought almost as quickly as it came up, but not quite as fast.</p>
            <p id="romance7">Dio burst out of the crowd into an open space in front of the doors to the library, almost bumping into Emma as she turned around. A small smile broke out on her face. “You have this absolutely intelligent look on your face.”</p>
            <p id="romance8">“And here I was thinking that friends were suppose to be nice to one another.” Dio sarcastically groaned.</p>
            <p id="romance9">“I kid, I kid. Now let’s look for some snazzy books. I know a great short story that you should like, It’s called ‘The Avocado Tree’ and I think you would like it.”</p>
            <p id="romance10">“There you go again about actually getting me to read. I just came with you so I don’t need to deal with Ethan’s teasing. He is nice to be around sometimes, but other times, he can really get on my nerves.”</p>
            <p id="romance11">“Yea, I get what you mean. But was that the only reason you came with me?” Emma put her hand up to her chest in a look of taking offense, her mouth open in a gasp.</p>
            <p id="romance12">“You and your acting again. Just audition for a role in the school play, you have the looks and the skills for it.”</p>
            <p id="romance13">“I know right? I would totally do well in it.” she giggled, completely dropping the pretense of being offended. “Also, was that a compliment to my looks I heard?</p>
            <p id="romance14">“Uh,” Dio’s brain just stopped. “No… why would I ever do that?” he responded awkwardly.</p>
            <p id="romance15">“Wow, now I am just actually offended. Do I never look good enough for a compliment?” she accused.</p>
            <p id="romance16">“That’s not what I am saying, you look good Emma, like better than Ethan and he thinks he has the best fashion sense out of us.” Dio stated. Emma looked a little surprised and flustered in response to that, but then quickly changed to an expression of mocking questioning with an eyebrow raised. “That’s not what I meant… I’m just making this worse for myself aren’t I?”</p>
            <p id="romance17">She nodded vigorously with a smile on her face. “It’s really funny when you mess up a conversation so much and it becomes so awkward you just have to give up.”</p>
            <p id="romance18">The bell rang just as Emma opened her mouth to talk. “Oops, I’m not going to be late for class I don’t know what you are talking about.” she joked as she sprinted off towards her next class leaving Dio standing alone as other students rushed out of the library.</p>
            <p id="romance19">He never thought running to class after the bell rang would be of any use because if someone was going to be late, might as well be a little more late and not stress over running to class. Getting to class a minute or two later wouldn’t change the fact that he was late and the teacher would look down upon him and he could get some quiet time to himself, but then again, every other student would look down upon him if he didn’t run for class.</p>
            <p id="romance20" class="choice"><button id="runClass">Run for class</button> <button id="walkClass">Don't run for class</button></p>
                <p id="runClass1">Dio took off running for class, running as hard as he could, in a desperate hope to get to class before the bell would finish ringing, deciding that he didn’t want the other students running to class to judge him for leisurely walking through the halls. The only sound he could hear was his footsteps ringing out against the concrete as he pushed himself to run as fast as he could.</p>
                <p id="walkClass1">He started slowly walking to his chemistry class. Was I just imagining things, or did Emma blush a little bit when I said that she looked good? Did she actually feel a little embarrassed with that? I mean she does look good, and that wasn’t necessarily false, but… His mind drifted away from the thought to how red he face was getting and started to run for class.</p>
            <p id="romance21">He burst through the doorway, standing there to catch his breath as everybody turned to face him, their stare seemed like they were aiming down a crosshair.</p>
            <p id="romance22">Mr. Duncan spoke in his usual monotone voice that seemed mock him every time he spoke to someone like that. “How kind of you to show up late for class. Please take your seat without any further disruption.”</p>
            <p id="romance23">“Sorry, I got distracted and didn’t notice the time.” Dio responded.</p>
            <p id="romance24">“Yes, by reading ‘The Avocado Tree’? It must be a very long and engaging story as it is a whopping one hundred and fifty one words long.” Dio’s face turned red again as some students laughed at the sarcastic response from the teacher. “Take your seat without further disruption.” Dio grudgingly made his way to his seat which was next to Alex’s desk.</p>
            <p id="romance25">“Why is he so good at that?” Dio whispered.</p>
            <p id="romance26">“So good at what? Also more importantly, why were you late? You know Mr. Duncan makes fun of people who enter his class late. You really are such an egg sometimes.” Alex’s voice came off from the side, but he looked forward and was taking notes as if nothing was happening. Dio leaned closer to Alex’s ear to make sure nobody else heard what he was going to clarify.</p>
            <p id="romance27">“I said without further disruption, or do you need to go back to fifth grade to learn what without disruption means?” Mr. Duncan shot across the room without turning away from the whiteboard. His face Dio hoped that he could be with Emma at the moment, or Ethan, anywhere other than there. The class faded to the background as he thought about his conversation with her from earlier. Is something going on with her? I didn’t think she usually would get that nervous about that? I can just talk to her during break about it.</p>
            <p id="romance28">The class went by as a slow drag. Balancing chemical equations just couldn’t keep Dio’s interest as his mind wandered. What am I going to have for dinner tonight? He sighed to himself as his mind started to wander back to Emma. I can’t help but just think about her right now. Does that mean I like her? If so, what does that mean? These thoughts started to overwhelm his head, the thoughts swarming around, and soon he was lost in his thoughts, oblivious to what was around him. The bell rang which brought him out of his thoughts long enough for him to recognise that the class was over, and it was break.</p>
            <p id="romance29">Alright, so maybe I do like Emma just a little tiny bit. That doesn’t change how I should feel around her right? Me, her, Alex and Ethan can be friends all the same anyways right? I hope so, I don’t know what I would do without them. And what if she doesn’t like me back? Then what happens? Won’t it be awkward in the friend group? Alex shook Dio’s shoulder.</p>
            <p id="romance30">“My dude, class is over. Are you okay? You usually are the first one out of the room like five minutes before class ends, and yet here you are sitting in the room staring off into space.” Alex’s concerned voice helped Dio focus back onto what was in front of him.</p>
            <p id="romance31">“Yea, I think I’m alright, I was just a little lost in thought.”</p>
            <p id="romance32">“A little?”</p>
            <p id="romance33">“Maybe a little more than a little.” Dio admitted. The two boys left the classroom together and headed towards their usual gathering spot in the courtyard. Emma greeted them as they came up to the spot where they usually talked, but Ethan wasn’t there.</p>
            <p id="romance34">“Hey guys! Alex, did Dio manage to stay awake during chem today?” she cheerfully teased.</p>
            <p id="romance35">“Totally. He was awake, but totally messed up. Like his brain just wasn’t working.” Alex responded with a gentle smile.</p>
            <p id="romance36">“Mr. Duncan made fun of me for being late and holding ‘The Avocado Tree’ as I entered the room late.”</p>
            <p id="romance37">“That’s such a mood. I think I’m going to get a banana from the cafeteria, I’m a little hungry. See you guys later.” Emma went sprinting off out of the courtyard, her hair flying in a wild spread that seemed to draw Dio’s gaze and he was severely tempted to follow her.</p>
            <p id="romance38">Alex noticed the change in the gaze back to Dio. “Well, I’m going to search for Ethan. He usually meets us here but I don’t know where he is. Let’s go.”</p>
            <p id="romance39">Dio’s mind raced. I want to go talk with Emma, but I think that’s a little weird if I just follow her for no reason. Like usually I hang out with Alex and Ethan when I have the chance, but I just want to talk to her. It’s not like I like her or anything, it’ll just be a normal conversation.</p>
            <p id="romance40" class="choice"><button id="followHer">Follow her</button> <button id="noFollow">Don't follow her</button></p>
                <p id="followHer1">“I think I’ll go to the cafeteria. I’m a bit hungry too, and I can get some free food from Emma. People from the leadership group are always more friendly with popular people and are more likely to give out free food.”</p>
                <p id="followHer2">“Alright, I’ll go off and try to find Ethan, see you at lunch!”</p>
                <p id="followHer3">“See you!” Dio jogged off after Emma. The rest of the world faded away as he moved through the crowd, ghosting through without any thought on anything else. His heartbeat pounded loudly, the only sound he could hear, the rest of the world a muffled jumble. Why am I like this? Why do I feel this way? Is this what liking somebody feels like? That’s an interesting thought. But we have been friends for a few years now, so why now? These thoughts plagued him as he moved through the crowd. What should I say? Do I want to enter into a relationship with her? If yes what do I say to make it not awkward? These thoughts came to a screeching halt as he bumped into a person right in front of him.</p>
                <p id="followHer4">“Sorry about that, I was lost in thought.” Dio carefully explained, hoping this random person wouldn’t stare.</p>
                <p id="followHer5">“You silly egg, what are you doing here?” The voice was recognizable, with a hint of amusement. Dio looked up and saw a recognisable face. Ethan.</p>
                <p id="followHer6">“What are you doing here?” Dio responded, his face a little red, embarrassed because he thought he actually bumped into Emma.</p>
                <p id="followHer7">“I asked first.”</p>
                <p id="followHer8">“I was going to the cafeteria to get a banana.”</p>
                <p id="followHer9">“Really now?” Ethan shot Dio a sarcastic yet smug look.</p>
                <p id="followHer10">“Yes. I really was planning to go to the cafeteria and get a banana, but then you showed up.”</p>
                <p id="followHer11">“Alright then.” Ethan’s voice sounded like he was satisfied with the answer, and was about to leave. Then he said, “Guess I’ll come with!” Dio couldn’t do anything about it, so might as well accept what Ethan was going to do to him on the way. The two of them started to walk towards the cafeteria, Ethan continuously making comments that started to bother Dio more and more. “On your left!”</p>
                <p id="followHer12">“Yes, I know you are on my left, you have been walking there for the past thirty seconds.”</p>
                <p id="followHer13">“Just letting you know!” Ethan’s overly energetic comments seemed to bother Dio more than his direct insults. “I was worried you might have forgotten I was there, but anyways, why are you going to the cafeteria? You usually never go there...”</p>
                <p id="followHer14">“Alright because I’m hungry, and can you please stop following me? It’s kind of annoying.”</p>
                <p id="followHer15">Ethan turned to face him. “Alright man, see you at lunch then.” he said without his usual sarcastic voice, then smiled and turned around. Dio was relieved that his friend was willing to be so cooperative, as usually Ethan would keep following him making sarcastic comments until Dio said that he was looking for Emma or until he just gave up on trying to do that and just get rid of him.</p>
                <p id="followHer16">Dio made it to the cafeteria and Emma was standing there, right next to the wall, eating a banana. Wow, she looks really good. Wait what am I thinking, what? Why is that the first thought that I think of when I saw her?</p>
                <p id="followHer17">“Hi Dio, what are you doing here?” Emma cheerfully greeted.</p>
                <p id="followHer18" class="choice"><button id="confess">Confess</button> <button id="noConfess">Don't confess</button></p>
                    <p id="confess1">“Hi Emma, I came here to talk to you. Is it alright if we talk for a little bit? Maybe somewhere a little more private?” Dio carefully stammered.</p>
                    <p id="confess2">Emma responded warmly. “Alright.” The two of them made it out of the cafeteria, into an empty room. Dio’s mind raced, he couldn’t even hear his own voice, he was shaking just a little bit. The door closed with a gentle click, the two of them standing in the dark and silent room.</p>
                    <p id="confess3">“You see Emma,” Dio paused, not sure of how to get his point across without being to weird. I don’t want to be too weird, I am just going to say that I like her right? That’s actually all there is to it right? But what happens next? What if she just laughs at me? Things would become so weird in my friend group, also I don’t want to sound like a stalker, I just wanted to talk, I mean talk but like at the same time I want to tell her how I feel. That would be so awkward though, I’m just not talking and just blankly staring at her, what is happening? Well alright, let’s think of it from a new point of view. The faster I can get rejected, the faster I can be sad then recover from it, right? I can’t…</p>
                    <p id="confess4">“Yes.” The word cut though his thoughts like a hot knife through butter.</p>
                    <p id="confess5">“What?”</p>
                    <p id="confess6">“Yes.”</p>
                    <p id="confess7">“I heard you say yes so confidently, but I haven’t even said anything yet.”</p>
                    <p id="confess8">“You are about to say how you like me and you wanted to date.” Emma confidently stated. Dio’s mind melted into a little puddle of butter.</p>
                    <p id="confess9">“How did you...” he stammered, unable to come up with any sort of coherent response.</p>
                    <p id="confess10">“My dude, you are so obvious, you haven’t done this before have you? Honestly the moment you said you wanted to talk in private, it was super clear.”</p>
                    <p id="confess11">“Are you sure? Like, what?”</p>
                    <p id="confess12">“If I wasn’t sure why would I cut you out of your thoughts with a yes?” Emma maintained.</p>
                    <p id="confess13">Dio responded hesitantly, “I guess not. So um, we are dating now?”</p>
                    <p id="confess14">“What else did you think me saying yes to would mean?” she sarcastically responded.</p>
                    <p id="confess15">“Well, I guess it means we are dating then. What are you...” The ringing of the bell cut him off, and Emma took off running.</p>
                    <p id="confess16">“See you later!” she yelled as she disappeared out of the room, leaving Dio the dark room alone, smiling.</p>
                    
                    <p id="noConfess1">“Um, hi Emma, I was just coming to get a banana, I was a little hungry, and since you were getting one, I thought I could get one too since I was hungry.” Dio responded quietly.</p>
                    <p id="noConfess2">“Alright, then.” She looked at him with a sarcastic look that showed no sign of actually believing him. “I’ll be here.”</p>
                    <p id="noConfess3">“Actually can I talk to you for a bit?” Dio said, barely able to keep his feelings inside.</p>
                    <p id="noConfess4">“Sure.” The two of them made it out of the cafeteria, into an empty room. Dio’s mind raced, he couldn’t even hear his own voice, he was shaking just a little bit. The door closed with a gentle click, the two of them standing in the dark and silent room.</p>

            <p id="comedy1">ooallmam</p>
            <p id="chaos1">Dio: “Well I guess i’ll see you guys later, i’m out.”</p>
            <p id="chaos2">You ditch school because you’re tired of social interaction. You meet a guy in an alley and he asks if you want to buy a wakizashi. </p>

                    <p id="Decline2">Mysterious Figure: “That’s a real shame. Good luck making it through the rest of the day.” </p>
                    <p id="Decline3">He chuckles as you walk away</p>

                        <p id="Skip2">You head down to the closest convenience store. You buy some instant ramen and as you are leaving you notice Emma and Alex hanging out and checking out the snacks in another aisle. </p>

                            <p id="SocialInteraction1">You walk over to them and strike up a conversation.</p>
                            <p id="SocialInteraction2">Dio: “Hey guys how was school? Any classwork you can fill me in on?”</p>
                            <p id="SocialInteraction3">Alex: “School was pretty good, we got some english homework though.”</p>
                            <p id="SocialInteraction4">Dio: “Dang, that sucks.”</p>
                            <p id="SocialInteraction5">Alex: “Why did you decide to ditch?”</p>
            
                            <p id="WhatIsSociality1">You walk out and ignore them, you see Alex notice and start to say something but Emma cuts him off and draws his attention instead. You head back home and eat your instant ramen before playing more games and eventually going to bed. </p>

                        <p id="GoToSchool3">Teacher: “No he didn’t come in today so I marked him absent.”</p>
                        <p id="GoToSchool4">Dio: “Oh okay, nevermind then.”</p>
                        <p id="GoToSchool5">You send him a text and go to your seat. You sit through a boring class and have a hard time not falling asleep. Recess arrives and you meet up with your friends. </p>
