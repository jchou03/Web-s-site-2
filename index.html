            <p id="0"><strong>Dio is a Junior at Design Tech High School. Throughout this website you will play 5 different takes of his first week as a Junior.</strong></p>
            <p id="1">Dio woke with a start as his alarm clock blared in his ear. He groggily looked at the time- 7:30 A.M.- time to get up.</p>
            <p id="2">Dio gets ready for school in his purple shirt and yellow suit. Dio gets to school and meets three friends: Emma, Ethan and Alex. Alex was the chill guy who did well in his classes. He never missed a class and was always on top of his work. He wore a white striped polo shirt and khaki pants. Ethan was the typical cool kid who wore baggy black clothes, and always had his hair gelled. He didn’t care about school or grades at all, prefering to make jokes during class, distracting from the lesson, and had to be forced to pass his classes. He was very kind spirited though, always supportive of his friends, but he didn’t hesitate to make fun of them. Emma was the confident one in the group, more popular than the rest of them. Her long yellow hair contrasting with her faded blue T-shirt. She was more of a tomboy, more physically capable than even Alex, who was on the school track team. </p>
            <p id="3">
                They were hanging around in the school courtyard, the voices of the other students screaming becoming a white silence. The four of them in a sea of people which would be overwhelming to anybody not used to it.
                <br>"Today is super crowded huh?" Dio says as he approaches the group. "Usually I can at least see you guys from farther than five feet away."
                <br>"Imagine that." Emma responded with a quirky smile on her face.
                <br>"Good morning Dio. How did you sleep last night?"
                <br>Ethan laughed, "Alex, that’s the first thing you ask people in the morning? ‘How did you sleep last night?’ That’s so weird."
                <br>"I just thought it would be a kind way to greet somebody, and I was trying it out," Alex responded, "anyways, it’s better than you. You haven’t even said anything to Dio."
                <br>"Anyways, I think it is really crowded here, I kind of want to go somewhere else." Dio stated apologetically.
            </p>
            <p id="4">
                <br>“Alright, that makes sense. You wanna come to the library with me? I want to check out some new fiction books, and I think there might be a few that you might like.” Emma cunningly offered.
                <br>“Let’s go to class, I can get help with homework from the teacher,” Alex argued, “and you can actually catch up on yesterday’s work because someone decided to sleep through chemistry class yesterday.”
                <br>“Imagine actually trying to pass your classes.” Ethan just laughed wildly. “Oh! How could I not have realized earlier? You have to choose between the girl and actually passing your classes!”
                <br>“You jerk,” Emma gently punched Ethan on the arm. “I can’t believe you sometimes.”
                <br>“It was such a low hanging fruit though, and I went for it,” Ethan said as he rubbed his arm. “Also, have you ever thought of trying to not break arms when you punch people?”
                <br>“Absolutely, just not with you.” Emma responded sarcastically.
                <br>Alex interrupted before things got too out of hand, “Well you can keep trying to fight Emma, but I really don’t think you have a chance Ethan. Anyways, I should go before the teacher starts screaming at me for not coming early enough, are you coming with Dio?”

            </p>
            <p id="5" class="choice"><button id="normal">Go with Alex</button> <button id="depression">Go Alone</button> <button id="romance">Go with Emma</button> <button id="comedy">Go with Ethan</button> <button id="chaos">Skip School</button></p>
            <p id="normal1">“So, what did I end up missing yesterday?” Dio asked.</p>
            <p id="normal2">
                “Not too much, still mostly introducing the new unit, but there was some classwork that you missed. We can go talk to him and get another copy of the sheet, and you can copy my notes.” Alex replied.
            </p>
            <p id="normal3">“Ah, thanks, that’s a big help, I don’t think Mr. Duncan would be too happy with me if I didn’t have them”</p>
            <p id="normal4">“No worries.” Alex assured as they continued into the class and set their backpacks down on a couple of adjacent seats near the front. </p>
            <p id="normal5">“We’ve got a few minutes before class starts, want to see Mr. Duncan about the homework?”</p>
            <p id="normal6">
                “Sure, and you can grab the classwork page”
                They walked over to Mr. Duncan, and as Alex asked about the homework, Dio tried to look around the class for extra copies of the sheet - before eventually giving up and going over to Mr. Duncan to ask for one. When he got back to the desk, Alex had already started on the days sheet.
            </p>
            <p id="normal7">“Man, already starting with that? There’s still a minute or so before class starts”</p>
            <p id="normal8">“Well it’s mostly pretty easy, I think my middle school chem class covered a lot of this”</p>
            <p id="normal9">And you actually remember that?” Dio challenged. Alex just smiled and got back to work. Dio decided to see if he knew any of the stuff on the page, after a quick skim, though, he found himself completely disheartened. He didn’t recognize any of the terminology or formulas, and he had no idea how to even start the first problem. He decided just to wait for Mr. Duncan to explain in class.</p>
            <p id="normal10">“Alright class,” Mr. Duncan announced, “Let's start out with this.” He started drawing out a problem on the board. Dio was already bored, though, and thought: “maybe I should just sleep through this again... ”</p>
            <p id="normal11" class="choice"><button id="sleep">Go to Sleep</button> <button id="awake">Stay Awake</button></p>
                <p id="sleep1">Dio lays down on the table,shuts his eyes, and tries to drown out all of the classroom noise and get to sleep. After a few pokes from Alex, he finally succeeded, successfully dodging all of the classwork like an absolute gamer yet again. After class, Alex woke him up, and although he looked a little upset and disappointed, he insisted “It’s fine, but at least do the work at home tonight”</p>
                <p id="sleep2">“Sure, it looked pretty easy, so I should be able to finish it in half an hour or so.”</p>
                <p id="sleep3">“Sure, sure,” he paused for a moment, “There’s break now, isn’t there?”</p>
                <p id="sleep4">“Yup, why do you ask?”</p>
                <p id="sleep5">“I was wondering if I had enough time to go to the restroom”</p>
                <p id="sleep6">“Ah, well see you later then?”</p>
                <p id="sleep7">“See ya”</p>
                <p id="sleep8">They split ways after leaving the classroom, and the rest of the day went normally, <strong>good job!</strong></p>
                <p id="awake1">Dio stays up and tries to pay close attention to class and complete his classwork. After half an hour or so, he feels surprisingly fulfilled, having completed both of the classwork sheets, and now just requiring the notes from Alex. “Hey,” he asks, “Could I see your notes from yesterday?”</p>
                <p id="awake2">“Sure, honestly though I’m really surprised you were able to stay up throughout the whole lesson, nice job”</p>
                <p id="awake3">“Thanks”</p>
                <p id="awake4">After getting the notes, there is still about 20 minutes left in class, so he decides to get some more sleep. Alex gets him up at the end of class, and after packing up, and the rest of the day went normally, <strong>good job!</strong></p>


            <p id="depression1">“Actually, I have to go to the bathroom, I’ll see you guys later,” Dio said.</p>
            <p id="depression2">“Alright, see you later,” Emma replied as she turned to leave.</p>
            <p id="depression3">“Damn, I really think you need help, but I’ll see you around,” Alex said reluctantly.</p>
            <p id="depression4">Ethan walked up to Dio, “You failed to pick an option, you are now a loner... Just kidding. See you, dude.”</p>
            <p id="depression5">Dio’s friends walked away and he was left to wander in the sea of people that was his school. Dio didn’t actually have to use the bathroom and had just used it as an excuse to have some alone time.</p>
            <p id="depression6">He walked down the hall looking for a place to sit quietly and just think. As he walked, a familiar face came walking down the hall towards him. It was Ethan, knowing that he had lied to Alex about having to go to the bathroom, he had to find a way to avoid him. Luckily, there was a bathroom on the left.</p>
            <p id="depression7" class="choice"><button id="bathroom">Go to the Bathroom</button> <button id="walking">Keep Walking</button></p>
                <p id="bathroom1">Dio made a swift turn into the bathroom and the door shut behind him. He decided to wait for Ethan to pass without it seeming too suspicious, so he waited for a little bit. Suddenly he heard footsteps approach the door and he didn’t want to look weird just standing in the bathroom.</p>
                <p id="bathroom2" class="choice"><button class="option1">Jump into a Stall</button> <button class="option2">Start Washing Your Hands</button></p>

            <p id="romance1">“I think I’ll go with Emma. Thanks for the offer though Alex.” Dio stated. Ethan started to eye Dio up with a smirk, but remained silent. Dio shot back a sharp glare but Ethan kept that look on his face.</p>
            <p id="romance2">“Alright, just don’t come crying to me when you don’t have your chem notes.” Alex warned.</p>
            <p id="romance3">“Wait we had notes? Dude, Mr. Duncan grades so harshly on notes, I better get them done.”</p>
            <p id="romance4">“Yes oh my god, you are just such egg sometimes. Does that mean you are coming?”</p>
            <p id="romance5">“Lol, you thought. See you guys during break.” Dio dismissed Alex and Ethan and turned to walk towards the library with Emma. She smiled at him, then turning forward to push through the crowd. Her golden hair seemed to gently brush against his arm as he tried to stick close to her as they navigated the thick crowd. His body moved side to side as he bumped into backpack then arm, over and over, as he pushed through, following his focus on Emma who was way ahead of him at that point.</p>
            <p id="romance6">Have I always focused on Emma so much before? Dio thought. Eh, I’m trying to focus on not losing her in this crowd as we go the the library, it just makes sense. He dismissed the thought almost as quickly as it came up, but not quite as fast.</p>
            <p id="romance7">Dio burst out of the crowd into an open space in front of the doors to the library, almost bumping into Emma as she turned around. A small smile broke out on her face. “You have this absolutely intelligent look on your face.”</p>
            <p id="romance8">“And here I was thinking that friends were suppose to be nice to one another.” Dio sarcastically groaned.</p>
            <p id="romance9">“I kid, I kid. Now let’s look for some snazzy books. I know a great short story that you should like, It’s called ‘The Avocado Tree’ and I think you would like it.”</p>
            <p id="romance10">“There you go again about actually getting me to read. I just came with you so I don’t need to deal with Ethan’s teasing. He is nice to be around sometimes, but other times, he can really get on my nerves.”</p>
            <p id="romance11">“Yea, I get what you mean. But was that the only reason you came with me?” Emma put her hand up to her chest in a look of taking offense, her mouth open in a gasp.</p>
            <p id="romance12">“You and your acting again. Just audition for a role in the school play, you have the looks and the skills for it.”</p>
            <p id="romance13">“I know right? I would totally do well in it.” she giggled, completely dropping the pretense of being offended. “Also, was that a compliment to my looks I heard?</p>
            <p id="romance14">“Uh,” Dio’s brain just stopped. “No… why would I ever do that?” he responded awkwardly.</p>
            <p id="romance15">“Wow, now I am just actually offended. Do I never look good enough for a compliment?” she accused.</p>
            <p id="romance16">“That’s not what I am saying, you look good Emma, like better than Ethan and he thinks he has the best fashion sense out of us.” Dio stated. Emma looked a little surprised and flustered in response to that, but then quickly changed to an expression of mocking questioning with an eyebrow raised. “That’s not what I meant… I’m just making this worse for myself aren’t I?”</p>
            <p id="romance17">She nodded vigorously with a smile on her face. “It’s really funny when you mess up a conversation so much and it becomes so awkward you just have to give up.”</p>
            <p id="romance18">The bell rang just as Emma opened her mouth to talk. “Oops, I’m not going to be late for class I don’t know what you are talking about.” she joked as she sprinted off towards her next class leaving Dio standing alone as other students rushed out of the library.</p>
            <p id="romance19">He never thought running to class after the bell rang would be of any use because if someone was going to be late, might as well be a little more late and not stress over running to class. Getting to class a minute or two later wouldn’t change the fact that he was late and the teacher would look down upon him and he could get some quiet time to himself, but then again, every other student would look down upon him if he didn’t run for class.</p>
            <p id="romance20" class="choice"><button id="runClass">Run for class</button> <button id="walkClass">Don't run for class</button></p>
                <p id="runClass1">Dio took off running for class, running as hard as he could, in a desperate hope to get to class before the bell would finish ringing, deciding that he didn’t want the other students running to class to judge him for leisurely walking through the halls. The only sound he could hear was his footsteps ringing out against the concrete as he pushed himself to run as fast as he could.</p>
                <p id="walkClass1">He started slowly walking to his chemistry class. Was I just imagining things, or did Emma blush a little bit when I said that she looked good? Did she actually feel a little embarrassed with that? I mean she does look good, and that wasn’t necessarily false, but… His mind drifted away from the thought to how red he face was getting and started to run for class.</p>
            <p id="romance21">He burst through the doorway, standing there to catch his breath as everybody turned to face him, their stare seemed like they were aiming down a crosshair.</p>
            <p id="romance22">Mr. Duncan spoke in his usual monotone voice that seemed mock him every time he spoke to someone like that. “How kind of you to show up late for class. Please take your seat without any further disruption.”</p>
            <p id="romance23">“Sorry, I got distracted and didn’t notice the time.” Dio responded.</p>
            <p id="romance24">“Yes, by reading ‘The Avocado Tree’? It must be a very long and engaging story as it is a whopping one hundred and fifty one words long.” Dio’s face turned red again as some students laughed at the sarcastic response from the teacher. “Take your seat without further disruption.” Dio grudgingly made his way to his seat which was next to Alex’s desk.</p>
            <p id="romance25"></p>

            <p id="comedy1">ooallmam</p>
            <p id="chaos1">Dio: “Well I guess i’ll see you guys later, i’m out.”</p>
            <p id="chaos2">You ditch school because you’re tired of social interaction. You meet a guy in an alley and he asks if you want to buy a wakizashi. </p>
            <p id="chaos3" class="choice"><button id="Accept">Accept</button> <button id="Decline">Decline</button></p>
            <p id="Accept1">You take him up on his offer and put it in your backpack. </p>
                    <p id="Accept2">“Good” He says as you walk away</p>
                    <p id="Accept3" class="choice"><button id="GoToSchool">Go back to school</button> <button id="Skip">Go home</button></p>
                    <p id="Decline1">Dio: “No I think im good, thanks for the offer though.”</p>
                    <p id="Decline2">Mysterious Figure: “That’s a real shame. Good luck making it through the rest of the day.” </p>
                    <p id="Decline3">He chuckles as you walk away</p>
                    <p id="Decline4" class="choice"><button id="GoToSchool">Go back to school</button> <button id="Skip">Go home</button></p>
                        <p id="Skip1">You decide not to go back to school and instead head home to play some videogames. Later in the day you get hungry and check the fridge. Empty “Ugh goddamnit, now I have to go to the convenience store.”</p>
                        <p id="Skip2">You head down to the closest convenience store. You buy some instant ramen and as you are leaving you notice Emma and Alex hanging out and checking out the snacks in another aisle. </p>
                        <p id="Skip3" class="choice"><button id="SocialInteraction">Social Interaction</button> <button id="WhatIsSociality">What's being social?</button></p>
                        <p id="GoToSchool1">You decide to go to school afterwards. As you arrive back at school you head to second period and notice that Ethan is missing. </p>
                        <p id="GoToSchool2">Dio: “Hey Sensei, did you see Ethan today?”</p>
                        <p id="GoToSchool3">Teacher: “No he didn’t come in today so I marked him absent.”</p>
                        <p id="GoToSchool4">Dio: “Oh okay, nevermind then.”</p>
                        <p id="GoToSchool5">You send him a text and go to your seat. You sit through a boring class and have a hard time not falling asleep. Recess arrives and you meet up with your friends. </p>
