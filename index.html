            <p id="0"><strong>Dio is a Junior at Design Tech High School. Throughout this website you will play 5 different takes of his first week as a Junior.</strong></p>
            <p id="1">Dio woke with a start as his alarm clock blared in his ear. He groggily looked at the time- 7:30 A.M.- time to get up.</p>
            <p id="2">Dio gets ready for school in his purple shirt and yellow suit. Dio gets to school and meets three friends: Emma, Ethan and Alex. Alex was the chill guy who did well in his classes. He never missed a class and was always on top of his work. He wore a white striped polo shirt and khaki pants. Ethan was the typical cool kid who wore baggy black clothes, and always had his hair gelled. He didn’t care about school or grades at all, prefering to make jokes during class, distracting from the lesson, and had to be forced to pass his classes. He was very kind spirited though, always supportive of his friends, but he didn’t hesitate to make fun of them. Emma was the confident one in the group, more popular than the rest of them. Her long yellow hair contrasting with her faded blue T-shirt. She was more of a tomboy, more physically capable than even Alex, who was on the school track team. </p>
            <p id="3">
                They were hanging around in the school courtyard, the voices of the other students screaming becoming a white silence. The four of them in a sea of people which would be overwhelming to anybody not used to it.
                <br>"Today is super crowded huh?" Dio says as he approaches the group. "Usually I can at least see you guys from farther than five feet away."
                <br>"Imagine that." Emma responded with a quirky smile on her face.
                <br>"Good morning Dio. How did you sleep last night?"
                <br>Ethan laughed, "Alex, that’s the first thing you ask people in the morning? ‘How did you sleep last night?’ That’s so weird."
                <br>"I just thought it would be a kind way to greet somebody, and I was trying it out," Alex responded, "anyways, it’s better than you. You haven’t even said anything to Dio."
                <br>"Anyways, I think it is really crowded here, I kind of want to go somewhere else." Dio stated apologetically.
            </p>
            <p id="4">
                <br>“Alright, that makes sense. You wanna come to the library with me? I want to check out some new fiction books, and I think there might be a few that you might like.” Emma cunningly offered.
                <br>“Let’s go to class, I can get help with homework from the teacher,” Alex argued, “and you can actually catch up on yesterday’s work because someone decided to sleep through chemistry class yesterday.”
                <br>“Imagine actually trying to pass your classes.” Ethan just laughed wildly. “Oh! How could I not have realized earlier? You have to choose between the girl and actually passing your classes!”
                <br>“You jerk,” Emma gently punched Ethan on the arm. “I can’t believe you sometimes.”
                <br>“It was such a low hanging fruit though, and I went for it,” Ethan said as he rubbed his arm. “Also, have you ever thought of trying to not break arms when you punch people?”
                <br>“Absolutely, just not with you.” Emma responded sarcastically.
                <br>Alex interrupted before things got too out of hand, “Well you can keep trying to fight Emma, but I really don’t think you have a chance Ethan. Anyways, I should go before the teacher starts screaming at me for not coming early enough, are you coming with Dio?”

                <p id ="depression1">“Actually, I have to go to the bathroom, I’ll see you guys later,” Dio said.</p>
                <p id ="depression2">“Alright, see you later,” Emma replied as she turned to leave.</p>
                <p id ="depression3">“Damn, I really think you need help, but I’ll see you around,” Alex said reluctantly.</p>
                <p id ="depression4">Ethan walked up to Dio, “You failed to pick an option, you are now a loner... Just kidding. See you, dude.”</p>
                <p id ="depression5">Dio’s friends walked away and he was left to wander in the sea of people that was his school. Dio didn’t actually have to use the bathroom and had just used it as an excuse to have some alone time.</p>
                <p id ="depression6">He walked down the hall looking for a place to sit quietly and just think. As he walked, a familiar face came walking down the hall towards him. It was Ethan, knowing that he had lied to Alex about having to go to the bathroom, he had to find a way to avoid him. Luckily, there was a bathroom on the left.</p>

                    <p id ="bathroom1">Dio made a swift turn into the bathroom and the door shut behind him. He decided to wait for Ethan to pass without it seeming too suspicious, so he waited for a little bit. Suddenly he heard footsteps approach the door and he didn’t want to look weird just standing in the bathroom.</p>
